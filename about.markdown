Hi! I'm Yitao. This is my blog hosted on github page and powered by Jekyll(and I'm currently using the minima template). 

Find out more about me at [my github page][yitao-yu]. 

I'm here to blog about things technical, interesting or to present my side projects or recent thoughts.

I hope you'll find those interesting. 
 
I appreciate the helps from the community and I do have things that I want to pass on as a community members.

# Principles

- Use: free(free to distribute, free to tinker, free so that **use responsibly**) > closely related with the open source community > [free architechture][freearch](or reasonably charged) > accessible

- For: Reapeatable(in terms of the workflow implemented); Assessable(in terms of automatically assessing the performance, if needed throughout time) ; Stable *if can*(in terms of the performance itself can be relatively robust on datasets for similar purpose or robust throughout time)
